*Waleed Masoud - Sample SQL code - using Base SAS 9.4;
*Creating new table called research1 that has column attributes: total, grade, race;

proc sql;
create table research1
	(
		total num,
		grade char(25) ,
		race char(25)
	);
quit;

*Adding in data points into the new table (research1);

proc sql;
insert into research1
	set total = 30,
		grade = 'Freshman',
		Race = 'Caucasian'
	set total = 32,
		grade = 'Sophomore',
		Race = 'Hispanic';
quit;

*Using a dataset titled "Research" Which contains data from high school students that took a pre-test and a post-test;
*Using dataset "Research", looking at the average test scores of the students pre-tests and post-tests and comparing them by grade;

proc sql;
title "Test Scores from Pre to Post";
select grade, avg(total) as Pretest_Total
from research
group by grade;
select grade, avg(total) as Posttest_Total
from researchpost
group by grade;
quit;

*Looking at specifically, Freshman and Sophomore students test scores;
proc sql;
select grade, avg(total) as Pretest_Total
from research
group by grade
having grade = "Freshman" or grade =  "Sophomore";
select grade, avg(total) as Posttest_Total
from researchpost
group by grade
having grade = "Freshman" or grade =  "Sophomore";
quit;

*Looking at dataset "patientrpt", choosing which variables I want from the dataset and making a legible report for the patient, specifically in-patients;
proc sql;
title "Patient Claims Report";
select 
	clnum label = "Claim Number", 
	name,
	Pssn  label = "Patient SSN", /*need to format for full number*/
	clamount label = "Claim Amount",
	paidamount label = "Paid Amount"
	from patientrpt
	where Type = "in";
quit;
